Codebook for the data set tidyData.txt which summarizes the average of each variable by activity and subject.
This codebook were automatically generated using the codebook library.

```{r setup}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  warning = TRUE, # show warnings during codebook generation
  message = TRUE, # show messages during codebook generation
  error = TRUE, # do not interrupt codebook generation in case of errors,
                # usually better for debugging
  echo = TRUE  # show R code
)
ggplot2::theme_set(ggplot2::theme_bw())

```



```{r prepare_codebook}
library(codebook)
#codebook_data <- rio::import
# to import an SPSS file from the same folder uncomment and edit the line below
 codebook_data <- tidyData
# for Stata
# codebook_data <- rio::import("mydata.dta")
# for CSV
# codebook_data <- rio::import("mydata.csv")

# omit the following lines, if your missing values are already properly labelled
codebook_data <- detect_missing(codebook_data,
    only_labelled = TRUE, # only labelled values are autodetected as
                                   # missing
    negative_values_are_missing = FALSE, # negative values are missing values
    ninety_nine_problems = TRUE,   # 99/999 are missing values, if they
                                   # are more than 5 MAD from the median
    )

# If you are not using formr, the codebook package needs to guess which items
# form a scale. The following line finds item aggregates with names like this:
# scale = scale_1 + scale_2R + scale_3R
# identifying these aggregates allows the codebook function to
# automatically compute reliabilities.
# However, it will not reverse items automatically.
codebook_data <- detect_scales(codebook_data)
```




```{r codebook}
